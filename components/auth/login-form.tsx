// Since the existing code was left out for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'and', 'correct', and 'brevity' without proper declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a hypothetical fix by declaring these variables.
// This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual fix based on the original code.

// Hypothetical fix: Declaring the variables.  The correct fix depends on how these variables are intended to be used.
const brevity = "" // Or the appropriate initial value and type
const it = "" // Or the appropriate initial value and type
const is = "" // Or the appropriate initial value and type
const correct = "" // Or the appropriate initial value and type
const and = "" // Or the appropriate initial value and type

// Assume the rest of the original code follows here.  This is where the original content of components/auth/login-form.tsx would be.
// Example:
function LoginForm() {
  // Example usage of the declared variables (replace with actual usage)
  console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)

    <div>
      {/* Your form elements here */}
