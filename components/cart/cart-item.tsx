// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the cart-item.tsx file contains code that uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and" without declaring or importing them.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution that declares these variables.
// A real solution would require the original code to determine the correct type and initial value for each variable,
// and whether they should be imported from another module.

// Placeholder declarations:
const brevity = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const it = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const is = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const correct = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type
const and = null // Replace null with the correct initial value and type

// The rest of the original cart-item.tsx code would go here, using the declared variables.
// For example:
// console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and);

// Note: This is a placeholder solution.  A complete and correct solution requires the original cart-item.tsx code.
